This dataset contained every incidence of lethal overdose recorded by the coroner in Marion County from 2010-2018. This included variables such as the patients name, SSN, demographics, toxicology results at time of death, and other details about death such as location. To obtain clinical data on these individuals, variables such as name, SSN, and date of birth were used to match patients from the coroner data to the INPCR database.">
