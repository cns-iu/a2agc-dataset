## Singularity

A Docker container is provided that installs all the dependencies needed for building the A2AGC dataset. You can install the container using this command: `singularity build container.sif docker://cnsiu/a2agc-dataset`. This will create a `container.sif` file that can be invoked on command line: `$ ./container.sif` which will bring you into the container with all dependencies installed and at a shell prompt.
