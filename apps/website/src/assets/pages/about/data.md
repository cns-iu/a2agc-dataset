Our team collaborated with several organizations to create four independent data sources, consisting of over 1 million data elements, which were used to construct the individually linked dataset of individuals who experienced fatal opioid overdoses in Marion County. The sources and their approximate data elements include:

1. 2,300 death certificates and toxicology results from the Marion County Coroner’s Office (MCCO);
2. 750,000 healthcare data elements, including referrals, medications, encounters and diagnoses, from the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), which connects more than 100 hospitals, 14,000 practices and nearly 40,000 providers who contribute healthcare data on over 66.7% of Indiana’s population;
3. 2,400 first responder runs performed by the Indianapolis Emergency Medical Services (IEMS); and
4. 5,500 jail data elements from the Marion County Sherriff’s Office (MCSO).

**Drug Overdose Deaths**  
Data from the MCCO served as the starting basis for our entire data linkage. MCCO provided vital record and toxicology information on all the accidental fatal overdoses that occurred in Marion County, Indiana, for the years 2010-2018. Vital records include the entire death certificate for each decedent. Demographic information includes name, sex, race, date of birth, home address, marital status, education and employment. Toxicology reports contain information on all substances that were detected in the decedent at the time of their death.
In order to help us obtain this information, the MCCO first provides a list of case numbers which were determined to be accidental fatal overdoses. A researcher then accesses the MCCO's database to search for each case and manually extract information from vital records and toxicology reports. Data collection for toxicology data has been ongoing since 2015 by Brad Ray, Director, Center for Behavioral Health and Justice at Wayne State University.

**Emergency Medical Services**  
IEMS provides data on all first responder runs that IEMS were called to from 2011-2018. This data contains the demographic information (first and last name, gender, race, date of birth, and age) of the person who the run was called for, location and time of the run, and the reasons why EMS was called (chief complaints and mechanism of injury). This data was provided upon request directly by IEMS.

**Arrest Information**  
The sheriff's office provides data on all jail bookings that occurred in Marion County from 2014-2018. Information that is available within this dataset includes demographic information (first and last name, gender, race, birth date, and age), booking and release date, description of the offense, and jail admission information. The data was provided upon request directly from the MCSO.

**Regenstrief Institute Data Core**  
The INPC is managed by the Regenstrief Institute and provides data from major hospitals, health networks, physician practices and insurance providers. Data provided from the INPC includes hospital admission data, discharge data, lab reports, diagnoses data, medications dispensed, procedure data, referral information, and encounter information (which includes emergency visits, inpatient/outpatient visits, or ambulatory encounters) starting from 2005. The data was provided directly by the Regenstrief Institute.

**Data Linkage**  
All data sources were linked by the Data Core at the Regenstrief Institute. The initial linkage was based off of all the accidental fatal overdoses that occurred in Marion County from 2010-2018. This comprised of approximately 2,300 cases in the 9 year time period. Data was linked primarily using the decedent first and last name, date of birth, and social security number (if available). Both IEMS and jail data contained only first and last name, and date of birth for linkage. We were able to match data from INPC using social security numbers as well as using the identifiers previously mentioned.

**Obtaining the Data**  
Beyond the coroner's data with toxicology and death certificate information, all data sources were obtained by request from their respective agencies.
