Our project _Advanced Analytics for IU's Addictions Grand Challenge (A2AGC)_ develops visualizations to help viewers gain insights from a rich set of data about opioid overdose deaths. The visualizations show aspects such as geographic distribution of deaths over time, and deaths in the context of demographics, by substances or their combinations. The data set is based on several linked data sets, which include overdose deaths, healthcare data, emergency medical services runs and arrest information. The data set has been created through a partnership with the Indiana Addictions Data Commons (IADC). Our visualizations are intended to serve as a foundational platform for research, policy development and practical interventions.
