# Opioid Death Trajectories
---------------------------

This example visualization shows opioid overdose deaths based on case history of opioid prescription, previous overdose, incarceration and encounters with health services.

## Purpose and Details

The purpose of this visualization is to provide insight on the frequency of common events that commonly occur before an overdose death.

Four touchpoints are analyzed:

1. Opioid Prescription (Rx): Whether or not an individual had received an opioid prescription. This includes any opioid or benzo medications that were provided to the individual.
2. Overdose (OD): Whether or not an individual had a previous overdose requiring EMS intervention. 
3. Incarceration (Jail): Whether or not an individual had been in jail.
4. Health Data (Health): Whether or not an individual had a recent encounter with healthcare services (excluding opioid prescriptions).

The visualization provides a comparison of the number of cases across each possible combination of the above touchpoints, including the case where no touchpoints apply (âˆ…).

Data was taken from four separate datasets corresponding to each of the four touchpoints. The timeframes for each dataset are as follows:

1. Medications: 2010-2018
2. EMS Incidents: 2011-2018
3. Incarcerations: 2014-2018
4. Health Encounters: 2010-2018

## Visualization

## Data and Graphic Variable Extraction

The table was created using the following SQL script:

{{ include_sql('src/visualization2/data.sql') }}

The resulting aggregated data can be found [here](../data/visualization2/data.csv).

Following rules were used to determined each of the following attributes:

1. Prescription VS No Prescription: True if any one of the flags OPIOD_FLAG or BENZO_FLAG was set in `medications` table for the particular CASE_NUMBER, False otherwise.
2. Overdose VS No Overdose: True if OVERDOSE_CC_MOI or NALOXONE_DUMMY was set in `ems_incidents` table for the particular CASE_NUMBER, False otherwise.
3. Justice Involvement VS No Involvement: If the particular CASE_NUMBER is present in `incarcerations` table then True, False otherwise.
4. Health Data VS No Health Data: True if CASE_NUMBER is present in `encounters` table, False otherwise.
