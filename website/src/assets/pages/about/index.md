### **Of the 1,852 fatal opioid overdoses in Indiana in 2017, Marion County accounted for 406, with a death rate almost fifty percent higher than the state’s average.**
  

To combat the opioid epidemic, Indiana University (IU) launched an initiative, *Responding to the Addictions Crisis Grand Challenge*, one of the nation’s largest and most comprehensive state-based responses to the addictions crisis. The initiative is a partnership with Indiana Gov. Eric J. Holcomb’s office, IU Health, and Eskenazi Health as well as 130 business, nonprofit, and government partners that engages a broad array of IU faculty.

The initiative’s goals are to reduce the number of Hoosiers with addictions, the number of deaths from drug overdoses, and the number of babies born exposed to substances. There are 32 teams working on projects ranging from lab-based neurobiological research to school-based educational programs; from analyses of policy and law to data gathering, analysis, and visualization; and from economic analysis to training and education of the addictions treatment workforce across the state.
