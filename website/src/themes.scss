// TODO(v15): As of v15 mat.legacy-core no longer includes default typography styles.
//  The following line adds:
//    1. Default typography styles for all components
//    2. Styles for typography hierarchy classes (e.g. .mat-headline-1)
//  If you specify typography styles for the components you use elsewhere, you should delete this line.
//  If you don't need the default component typographies but still want the hierarchy styles,
//  you can delete this line and instead use:
//    `@include mat.legacy-typography-hierarchy(map-get(default.$theme, typography));`
@include mat.all-legacy-component-typographies(map-get(default.$theme, typography));
@include mat.legacy-core();
